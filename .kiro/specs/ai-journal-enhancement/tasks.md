  - Implement partial success handling (save some items even if others fail)
  - Add user preference tracking for rejected/accepted suggestions
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 4.5, 4.6_



- [ ] 6. Create New API Endpoints for Real-time Analysis and Suggestions
  - Add `POST /api/journal/analyze-realtime` endpoint for typing analysis
  - Create `GET /api/journal/suggestions` endpoint for contextual prompts
  - Implement `GET /api/journal/context` endpoint for user data aggregation
  - Add proper authentication and rate limiting for new endpoints


  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Implement User Preference Learning System
  - Create new `UserPreferences` model for storing AI interaction preferences
  - Add preference tracking for suggestion acceptance/rejection patterns


  - Implement confidence threshold customization per user
  - Create preference-based suggestion filtering and prioritization
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6_

- [x] 8. Add Database Schema Enhancements for Confidence Scoring

  - Extend existing Journal model schema to include confidence scores for extracted data
  - Add indexes for efficient querying of user context data
  - Implement migration script for existing journal entries to support new schema
  - Add validation for confidence score ranges and extracted data formats
  - _Requirements: 3.6, 4.1, 5.1_



- [ ] 9. Implement Error Handling and Graceful Degradation
  - Add comprehensive error handling for AI service failures in journal workflow
  - Implement fallback behavior when real-time analysis is unavailable

  - Add component tests for journal confirmation modal and suggestion components



  - Implement end-to-end tests for complete journal entry to extraction workflow
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 11. Optimize Performance for Real-time Analysis
  - Implement debouncing logic for real-time analysis to prevent excessive API calls
  - Add caching layer for similar content analysis results
  - Optimize database queries for context data aggregation
  - Implement background processing for non-critical analysis tasks
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1, 5.1_

- [ ] 12. Integrate Enhanced Features into Existing Journal Interface
  - Update main `journal.tsx` component to include suggestion display
  - Wire together all enhanced components with proper state management
  - Add loading states and progress indicators for AI analysis
