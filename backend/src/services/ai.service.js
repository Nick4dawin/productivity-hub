2. TODO EXTRACTION: Extract any tasks the user mentions:
   - Past tasks: Things they've already done (use past tense verbs as indicators)
   - Future tasks: Things they plan to do (use future tense or intent words as indicators)
   - For each task, include:
     - Title (clear action item)
     - Time frame (past/future)
     - Due date (if mentioned, even if approximate like "next week" or "this weekend")

3. MEDIA EXTRACTION: Identify any media content mentioned:
   - Title of shows, movies, games, books, podcasts, music, etc.
   - Type of media (game, show, movie, book, etc.)
   - Status (watched, planning to watch, currently playing, etc.)

4. HABIT TRACKING: Identify any habits or routines:
   - Name of the habit
   - Status (completed/done or missed/skipped)
   - Frequency if mentioned (daily, weekly, etc.)
